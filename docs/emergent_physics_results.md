# Emergent Physics Simulation Results (Depth 9)

## 1. Parallel Transport

Paths:
- **path1**: fold around the x-axis then y-axis
- **path2**: fold around the y-axis then x-axis

At depth 9 the holonomy transformations are:

T1 = [[ 5.51e-16, 1.00, 5.51e-16], [0.00, 5.51e-16, -1.00], [-1.00, 5.51e-16, 3.04e-31]]

T2 = [[ 5.51e-16, 0.00, 1.00], [1.00, 5.51e-16, -5.51e-16], [-5.51e-16, 1.00, 3.04e-31]]

The commutator is:

[T1, T2] = [[ 2.0, 0.0, -3.63e-31], [0.0, -2.0, -4.34e-31], [3.63e-31, 4.34e-31, 0.0]].

The non‑zero commutator demonstrates **non‑Abelian holonomy** at depth 9.

## 2. Layer Hopping

For a path consisting of a fold around the x-axis, a hop inward and a fold around the y-axis, the layer‑hopping holonomy at depth 9 is:

T_hop = [[1.84e-16, 0.3333, 1.84e-16], [0.0, 1.84e-16, -0.3333], [-0.3333, 1.84e-16, 1.01e-31]].

The off‑diagonal 1/3 factors show the scaling associated with hopping between fractal layers.

## 3. Holonomy Group Order

Using an octant grouping model for the Menger sponge, the number of distinct holonomy classes grows exponentially as 8^depth.  At depth 9 the group order is:

8^9 = 134,217,728.

This rapid growth reflects the combinatorial complexity of holonomy classes on a Menger sponge fractal at deep levels.
