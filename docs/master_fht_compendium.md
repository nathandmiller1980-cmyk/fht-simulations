# Fractal Holonomy Theory (FHT) Compendium

This compendium consolidates core concepts, mathematical frameworks, topological
considerations, and preliminary simulation results relating to Fractal
Holonomy Theory.

## Foundations

- **Totality and recursion**: FHT posits an infinite, self-similar cosmos
  built from recursive geometries. Each layer emerges from the one below
  through golden-ratio scaling and SU(2)/U(1) symmetry breaking.
- **Functional abstractions**: The fractal substrate is treated as a
  metric-measure space with profinite topology. Hutchinson measures and
  gauge connections define layer-to-layer transitions.

## Mathematical Framework

- **Group theory**: Alternating SU(2) and U(1) connections manifest
  scale-dependent holonomy. Golden-ratio weighting determines the strength
  of each symmetry at a given depth.
- **Fractal topology**: Cantor- and Sierpinski-like structures serve as
  toy models for the underlying substrate. Measures on these sets give
  rise to non-integer dimensional dynamics.
- **Wilson loops and holonomy operators**: At larger depths, loop
  operators exhibit SU(2) behaviour, transitioning to U(1) at shallower
  scales.

## Topology Survey

- **Depth-dependent signatures**: Early depths (2–4) display SU(2)-like
  correlations, whereas deeper layers (5–6) show Fibonacci anyon
  statistics and irrational entanglement angles.
- **6D toy universe**: Extending the fractal substrate to higher
  dimensions yields Kaluza–Klein towers and emergent Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac
  dynamics.

## Simulation Synthesis

- **Entropy growth**: Toy simulations of entanglement entropy over fractal
  depths reveal ballistic growth followed by plateaus, consistent with
  holographic principles.
- **Non-commutativity vs integrability**: Depending on the strength of
  the SU(2) connection, the system can exhibit integrable or chaotic
  behaviour.

## Applications and Roadmap

Potential applications include topological quantum computing, exotic
condensed matter phases, and a possible link between information
propagation in fractal spaces and consciousness. Future work includes
extending simulations to deeper layers, formulating explicit Lagrangians
on fractal substrates, and benchmarking against known quantum gravity
models.
